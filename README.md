# FastAPI and Vue.js Application

This project is a test of building a web app using FastAPI for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend.

## Overview

The application consists of two main parts:

1. **Backend (FastAPI):** Provides RESTful APIs for CRUD operations and serves as the backend server for the application.
2. **Frontend (Vue.js):** A single-page application (SPA) built using Vue.js to interact with the backend APIs and render the user interface.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- CRUD operations for managing data entities
- Responsive user interface
- Integration of backend and frontend using RESTful APIs

## Technologies Used

### Backend

- **FastAPI:** FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **SQLAlchemy & SQLite:** SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.
- **Pydantic:** Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library for Python.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** JWT is used for user authentication and authorization.

### Frontend

- **Vue.js:** Vue.js is a progressive JavaScript framework for building interactive web interfaces.
