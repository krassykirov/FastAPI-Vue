# FastAPI and Vue.js Application

This project is a test of building a web app using FastAPI for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend.

## Overview

The application consists of two main parts:

1. **Backend (FastAPI):** Provides RESTful APIs for CRUD operations and serves as the backend server for the application.
2. **Frontend (Vue.js):** A single-page application (SPA) built using Vue.js to interact with the backend APIs and render the user interface.

## Features

- User registration and authentication (OAuth JWT)
- CRUD operations for managing data entities
- Responsive user interface
- Integration of backend and frontend using RESTful APIs

## Technologies Used
